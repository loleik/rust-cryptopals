# Cryptopals
These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges written in Rust.

## Uwage
If you'd like to try running these, follow this template: `cargo run -- run <SET> <PART> <INPUT>`

Or build and follow the same pattern: `./cryptopals-rust run <SET> <PATH> <INPUT>`

To run tests use: `cargo test`

## To do
+ Write part 6 to automatically step through key sizes to find the right one.
